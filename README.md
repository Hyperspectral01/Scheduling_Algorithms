# Scheduling Algorithms

This project implements various scheduling algorithms used in operating systems. It takes input in the form of [Name of the process, Arrival Time, Burst Time, Priority] and applies the following six algorithms:

1) First Come First Serve (FCFS)
2) Shortest Job First (SJF)
3) Priority Non-Preemptive
4) Round Robin
5) Shortest Remaining Time Next (SRTN)
6) Priority Preemptive

## Features

- **Input Format:** Processes are defined by their name, arrival time, burst time, and priority.
- **Algorithms Implemented:** FCFS, SJF, Priority Non-Preemptive, Round Robin, SRTN, Priority Preemptive.
- **Output:** Calculates the average turn around time and average waiting time for each algorithm along with the Gantt Charts.
