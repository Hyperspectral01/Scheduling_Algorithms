# Scheduling_Algorithms
Operating Systems

So it basically takes the input in the form of:[Name of the process , Arrival Time , Burst Time , Priority]
It runs the following 6 algorithms on the above data:
1)First Come First Serve [FCFS]
2)Shortest Job First [SJF]
3)Priority Non-Premptive
4)Round Robin
5)Shortest Remaining Time Next [SRTN]
6)Priority Premptive

It calculates the
1)Average Turn Around Time
2)Average Waiting Time

and finally displays the tables and the Gantt Charts for all the above 6 algorithms.
